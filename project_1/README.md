### What is the case?

Develop program that can guess the hidden number with minimal number of attempts.

**Competition conditions**
- Computer generates hidden integer number from 1 to 100 and we need to guess it for minimal number of attempts with another Python code;
- Script considers information about bigger or smaller guessed number from hidden number.

**Quality metric**

Result exemined by mean number of 1000 attempts.

**What are we practicing**

Practicing to write good code on Python
