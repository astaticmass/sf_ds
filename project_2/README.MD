**Competition Conditions:**  
- Computer generates integer number from 1 to 100 and we need to guess that number. Guess process will be done by binary search;
- Algorithm makes its decisions based on information about lesser or greater guessed number to random number.

**Quality metric**     
Result is rated by average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions.

**What do we practice?**     
We study to write good Python code.
